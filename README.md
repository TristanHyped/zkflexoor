ZKFlexoor is a zero-knowledge anonymous balance prover that allows you to prove you own a certain amount of HYPE tokens on Hyperliquid without revealing your actual wallet address or balance.

Think of it as a cryptographic receipt that says 'I have enough tokens' without showing your bank statement."

Why it's useful:
"For Hyperliquid traders, this opens up entirely new possibilities.

You can participate in whale-only events, access exclusive trading opportunities, or join private communities based on your holdings - all while maintaining complete privacy.

No more doxxing your wealth or exposing your trading strategies through public wallet addresses."

How it works:
"Technically, we use Merkle Patricia Tree proofs combined with zero-knowledge circuits to verify your balance against Hyperliquid's state tree.

In simple terms, imagine you have a secret safe with money inside.

Our system lets you prove to anyone that you have enough money in that safe without ever opening it or showing them where it is."

What it will become:
"This is just the beginning. Future versions will enable anonymous governance voting, private reputation systems, and even anonymous trading protocols. We're building the infrastructure for a truly private DeFi ecosystem where you can prove your credentials without compromising your privacy.
